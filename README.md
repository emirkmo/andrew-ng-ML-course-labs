# Labs for Andrew NG's Deep Learning Course 

Implemented in Python and following (some) Object-Oriented Design principles,
including SOLID, but also using elements of functional design patterns. 

The code is written to be easily extensible and maintainable without having to do
significant refactoring. Such as adding new cost functions, models, etc.

Each Course is a directory and each week has a single .py file per lab. The code is
written by me to complete the lab, so is not copied. The plotting is left to the
actual lab jupyter notebook, which is easier to use, and can be found by enrolling
in the course on Coursera.

Suggestions for improvement are welcome!
