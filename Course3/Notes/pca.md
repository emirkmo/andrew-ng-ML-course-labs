# PCA

Each pc is projection that "explains" maximum variance.
Used to be good for dimensionality reduction and compression
, especiall during training or feature selection,
but nowadays mainly used for visualization in AI/ML.

Eigen vector and eigen value for deeper understanding.

Just use sklearn.
I published a paper on this so need for more.
